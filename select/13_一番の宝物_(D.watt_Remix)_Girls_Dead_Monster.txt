Long before we each said goodbye
All our fights would make hate appear
I don't know those are the days i hold dear
You taught me how to be so fearless
Always pushing me further each day
Saying "You can overcome it all and
Find happiness along the way if you try"
I'll go on alone with the pain
And i swear that i won't complain
Cause I'll have the dream you gave me
To keep me strong just how i should be
You were once what made me happy
What i once had called my everything
But it faded and i could
Being with you was all just a dream
I once thought we would always be
And never cross the finish line
But i knew that was just a wish of mine
I don't regret being born any longer
I have learned to cherish life
Cause you gave me all you had and more
Though we now move on our separate ways without strife
I'll go on alone with the pain
And i swear that i won't complaint
Cause I'll have the drean you gave me
To keep me steong just how i should be
Even if i am far from you
When there's more than distance between us
I will pick myself up once more
With the strength i have thanks to you
I'll go on alone with the pain
Though i want to die, I'll restrain
It's your voicd that i can sti hear
Like a light that will not dissapear
Even if it's hard to move on
Even if i cannot stop my tears
My heart is earm because of you
And I'll hold that dear for all my years
Our time came and went by so fast
I know look back and make it last
I cannot recall what broke us
Into pieces like inside my heart
If i close my eyes i can hear
Someone laughing long ago with me
To this I've held that right here
Cause you're still most precious treasure
To this I've held that right here
Cause you're still most precious treasure
